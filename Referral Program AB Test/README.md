## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report focuses on an AB Test launched by Root. The AB test is used to analyze a new referral program aimed at increasing referrals. The collected result is analyzed using multivariate and cost benefit methodology. Based on the outcome of the analysis, the report develops recommendations and next step for further improvement of the referral program. The following are the recommended solutions:

•	I would recommend stopping the test and roll out the $50 0-day referral program, which will increase the total number of referrals by 68%, increase total revenue by 120%, and boost the profit by 55%. 

•	Increase the frequency of reminder messages sent to the users. Upon increasing the number of promotional messages to users (ex. sending the promo again after 5 days), we could test whether it will increase the volume of referrals. 

•	The third recommendation is to launch another test which offers the cash reward after receiver buy a policy to see if it will increase policy conversions.

•	We could also get real feedback from users who got a quote but eventually did not buy our policy and find out if there are other product and service attributes that require improvement.

## INTRODUCTION
The current referral program offers our customers a cash reward for referring their friends to our company. We typically give both sender and receiver $25 when the receiver gets a quote. Recently, a research revealed that more than half of the respondents said that they got 70% of their customers through referrals. Hence, referral has become an essential part of business growth. Additionally, it is cheaper for our company to pay for referrals than it is for us to advertise on websites like Google and Facebook.

To enhance market positioning, Root came up with an idea about a new referral program, which is to increase the $25 incentive to $50. Both sender and receiver will receive $50 if the receiver opens an account in our mobile app within the sender’s 30-day window and then eventually gets a quote. To test if the new referral program will increase referrals, we designed an A/B Testing. As shown below, we have two variations in our AB Test. The first variation is to increase the incentive from $25 to $50. The second variation is to have users receive promotion messages 0 day, 2 days, and 7 days after buying a policy. As the control group, the users never receive the $50 promotion bonus, as shown below.
