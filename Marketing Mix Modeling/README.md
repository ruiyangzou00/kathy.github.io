This Project is to help MAPE (E-Commerce Company) build its Marketing Mix Models. 

I firstly **cleaned and managed the ETL process in MySQL** and then used **Tableau to visualize the sales and independent variables** individually and performed deep dive on each variable. Then I leveraged **Python to build Marketing Mix Model to evaluate the impact of various marketing tactics**, including variables from the **economic condition, media situation, and competitor information**. After that, I built Tableau Dashboards to visualize model results; generated informative visualizations including **AVM, model contribution, and media ROIs** to deliver critical business insights. Also, I analyzed the **effectiveness and efficiency** of different media activities (e.g., **TV GRPs, Paid Search Clicks, Display Impressions**, etc.).Finally, I **optimize the budget** using Excel Solver for the following year and **increased sales by 2.6%**. Then I created decks to summarize model findings and **presented the results to the team**.
