Recently, the product analyst team decided to make some UX changes on product page. For example, they wanted to test whether the product details located at the bottom of the page may be distracting users from clicking Add-to-Cart buttom. Therefore, they came up with ideas of moving the product details to various location, such as right below the Add-to-Cart buttom or making the image smaller and moving up the details a bit. After discussion with product manager and engineers, they designed an A/B Testing (hereinafter called 'Test 1') with two variation groups and a control group as shown below.

But they did not realize there was another test (hereinafter called 'Test 3') ran on the same page by another group until they ended the test. There is the timeline of the two tests. From the picture below, we can see that both test started at April 12, 2019. Test 1 ended at May 21, 2019, while Test 3 ended earlier at May 10, 2019.

After the meeting with the other team, they figured out the content of Test 3, which is to add a free shipping banner right above the Add-To-Cart buttom. They assumed this change will remind users to realize the shipping fee in advance and consider adding more products on the cart before checkout. Here is the design of Test 3.

### Executive Summary
* Test 1 performs better when it comes to specific users like customers acquired by email and returning users. Suggest rolling out variation 1.

* Returning users react better on test 3. Suggest rolling out Test 3 on returning users and test the effect when moving the banner to checkout page.
